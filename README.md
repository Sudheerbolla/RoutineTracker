# Android-Project
The group project for mobile development CSIS 3175. the purpose of the app is a location tracker for health and wellbeing

for gitflow, while working on a specific feature create a new branch for it
	git checkout -b featurename
always make sure you push your changes so we dont have any conflicts
	git commit branchname -m "here is where you put the comment to let us know whats goin on"
	git push origin branchname
when your feature is done let Gregory Billings know and he will move it into the development branch.
try to have a feature in a workable state every 2 weeks(soonest one will come with the interim report Gregory will let you know so you have time to comment out anything broken) 
after we have this iteration gregory will create a new branch specifically for this version so we have some version control
once we have the version done we can pull it back down to our individual branches/workspaces

it is very important to create a new file for each feature so we minimize merge conflicts.
